Tacit Knowledge Migration TODO
=======================================================================

* Create a MigrationRunner-wide configuration mechanism, probably a properties
  file in the root of the classpath.  MigrationTaskSources could be
  defined in this file, along with any of their parameters.

* Add the flexibility to create JDBC connections from scratch to the JDBC
  MigrationLauncher.  This would allow applications to perform migrations with
  a different database user than the normal application uses.

* Make the bulk data SQL loader more robust.  Delegate less to subclasses.
