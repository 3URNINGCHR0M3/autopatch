	<h3>AutoPatch is sponsored by <a href="http://www.tacitknowledge.com">Tacit Knowledge</a></h3>

	<p>Tacit Knowledge is a software consulting firm that primarily focuses on Java-based e-commerce applications, though
	it also works with startups, does short-term troubleshooting, and has people that are highly skilled in other technologies when necessary.</p>

	<p>Tacit Knowledge uses a development process that focuses on the idea of "Continuous Deployment" - an agile process from requirements gathering through development and including operational
	tasks - allowing its clients not just to develop code efficiently, but to handle <b>all</b> aspects of their applications lifecycle efficiently.

	<p>AutoPatch has been developed over the last few years as an in-house tool for use by consultants at Tacit Knowledge.</p>

	<p>Over time, we realized that we were using it on all of our projects, and we were successfully delivering solutions without
	having to employ a single DBA. That's pretty useful.</p>

	<p>Finally, Tacit Knowledge realized that while it was incredibly valuable to us as a tool, AutoPatch isn't something we sell
	directly. As such, it is more useful for us to engage with the community that has given us so much by <a href="http://www.tacitknowledge.com/licenses-1.0">open-sourcing</a> the code, and hoping for useful feedback from others.</p>

	<p>This has been received well by our AutoPatch-using clients, and we have even received some patches from other folks (thank you!).</p>

	<p>We hope you enjoy using AutoPatch, we look forward to your <a href="contact_us.php">feedback</a>.</p>
