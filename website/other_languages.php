<h3>AutoPatch in other languages</h3>

<p>AutoPatch is an idea on how to apply an agile process to persistent storage more than an implementation.</p>

<p>As such, we have implemented this idea (to a larger or smaller degree) in other languages as well.

<p>We have basic implementations in PHP, Ruby (it's different than stock Migrations - it works on Windows/SQLServer), and .NET. <a href="contact_us.php">contact us</a> if you are interested.</p>
